p.1 = Two identical blocks of ice were brought into a warm room. The first block was left open, and the second was wrapped in a woolen scarf.
p.2 = Which block of ice will melt faster?
p.3 = 1. the first, since the process of heat exchange with the surrounding air will be faster.
p.4 = 2. the second, since the process of heat exchange with the ambient air will be faster.
p.5 = 3. the second, since the woolen scarf will additionally warm the ice.
p.6 = 4. The bars will start to melt at the same time.
