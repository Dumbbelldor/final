p.1 = What color of a hot kettle - black or white - will cool faster, all other things being equal, and why?
p.2 = 1. white, as it absorbs heat radiation more intensely
p.3 = 2. white, as the heat radiation from it is more intense
p.4 = 3. black, as it absorbs heat radiation more intensively
p.5 = 4. black, as the heat radiation from it is more intense
p.6 = Write down the number of the selected option in the answer field.
