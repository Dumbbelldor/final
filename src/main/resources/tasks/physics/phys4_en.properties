p.1 = In a cool room, there are two balls of the same size on the table: wood and steel.
p.2 = Which ball feels colder to the touch?
p.3 = 1. wood, since the density of wood is greater
p.4 = 2. wood, since the thermal conductivity of wood is greater
p.5 = 3. steel, since the density of steel is greater
p.6 = 4. steel, since the thermal conductivity of steel is greater
p.7 = Write down the number corresponding to your choice in the answer box.
